      <li>
        Quinque Development: The CCG is involved in the development and
        utilization of quinquesâ€”special weapons made from the kagune (predatory

        for Investigators in their battle against ghouls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investigative Body: The CCG conducts investigations to identify, track,

        Legal and Ethical Authority: As a formal institution, the CCG operates
        under legal frameworks and government oversight. Its decisions and
        actions have significant implications for both human and ghoul
        societies, raising questions about legality and morality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conflict Driver: The CCG plays a central role in the narrative conflict
        of "Tokyo Ghoul," driving much of the series' drama through its
        interactions with ghouls, its internal politics, and its complex
        relationships with characters who may sympathize with or oppose its
        methods.
