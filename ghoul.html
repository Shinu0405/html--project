    <ul>
      <li>
        Physical Characteristics: Ghouls appear mostly human but have distinct
        features such as kagune (predatory organs) and kakuja (advanced forms of
        kagune). They also have unique eye traits, including black sclera and
        varied iris colors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Diet and Behavior: Ghouls are carnivorous and primarily feed on human
        flesh. This need drives much of their behavior and creates conflict with
        humans, who are unaware of their existence and would view them as
        monsters.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reproduction and Life Cycle: Ghouls are born as ghouls and do not
        transform from humans. However, a human can become a ghoul through an
        organ transplant from a ghoul, leading to a "half-ghoul" state.
      </li>
      <li>
        Powers and Abilities: Ghouls possess enhanced strength, speed, and
        regenerative abilities. Their kagune serves as a powerful weapon, making
        them formidable opponents.
      </li>
      <li>
        Society and Culture: Ghouls have an underground society with their own
        social structures and cultural norms. They often form factions or
        organizations with specific goals and conflicts.
